TclLuX is a collection of packages,
each offering some loosely-categorized
form of UNIX functionality.

There are no interdependencies.
All packages are independent and
can be built and used individually.

The toplevel build setup works with
all the packages as a group.

Examples in the toplevel dir require
two or more TclLuX packages.


This package should build easily on any POSIX system.

This package uses Spot o' Conf to configure and build.

By default, this package will be configured to build
threaded for Tcl 8.6 (threaded) on OpenBSD.
